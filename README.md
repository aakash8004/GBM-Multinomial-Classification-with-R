# GBM-Multinomial-Classification-with-R
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. 
The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. 
We will apply GBM model technique to classify the Species of Iris Flower.
